The best way to learn iFEM is to do the following projects designed for Math 226: Numerical PDE in UC Irvine. 

* [Finite Difference Methods in 1-D](projectFDM1D.html)
* [Finite Difference Methods](projectFDM.html)
* [Linear Finite Element Method]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/project-fem.md %})
* [Fast Multipole Methods](projectFMM.html)
* [Multigrid Methods](projectMG.html)
* [Nonlinear Poisson Boltzmann Equation](projectPBE.html)
* [Adaptive FEM for PBE](projectPBEafem.html)
