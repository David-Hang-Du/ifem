We explain the basic mesh data structure: `(node,elem)` representing a mesh, `bdFlag` for boundary conditions, and the auxiliary data structures for exploring the mesh. We also discuss several ordering for simplical complexes in 2-D and 3-D which is helpful for orientation dependent data structure.
