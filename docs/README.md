# Introduction to iFEM
*i*FEM is a MATLAB software package containing robust, efficient, and easy-following codes 
for the main building blocks of adaptive finite element methods and multigrid methods 
on unstructured simplicial grids in both two and three dimensions. Besides the simplicity and readability, sparse matrixlization, an innovative programming style for MATLAB, is introduced to improve the efficiency.
